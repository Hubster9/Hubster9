Hi, I'm Hubster9.  

I am currently pursuing the Google Coursera certificate, Google IT Support Professional, through Per Scholas.
I just joined GitHub because I wanted more exposure to the world of information technology (IT), and to discover what aspects of what I'm learning in the Google IT Support Professional Certificate are used in industry and on actual projects.
I figure that I would check in on GitHub daily and discover what projects people actually work on in the Computer Science and Information Technology space.
The one aspect of IT and Computer Science that I'm most enthusiastic about is data analytics and understanding how different variables affect people's buying decisions (e.g. time of day, weather's impact on behavior).
Generally, I find that the information presented in the Google Coursera Certificate Course can be rather dense, e.g. the specifics of networking and how routers, switches, and the networking stack within a computer work to transmit data packets.
The course presents all of this information, and I want to solidify my knowledge regarding what I've seen in the videos and quizzes on Google Coursera through GitHub projects, which is what I'm hoping to discover here.
For the most part, I'm looking for a community of people that are enthused about IT and computer science who think of interesting projects.

Personally, I am not very interested in the world of gaming, I am more interested in IT as it relates to its use in factory automation (PLCs, I/O modules, programming stamping machines, furnaces), organizing data (e.g. Python scripts that rename all of your ski photos based on some theme that came to mind), and data analytics as it relates to human behavior/purchasing decisions/etc.
My biggest hope would be to discover a community of people who enjoy the power of computers/IT in creating more efficient lives for everyone, e.g. designing computer programs that can analyze ski video clips and find portions of the video where you fall or connect a lot of turns or ski very fast, I'm sure GoPro has designed software products like this, but I would like to participate in developing simplified versions of these software products that get me exposed to the programming principles involved in AI/machine learning that can basically watch through all of your 5 hours worth of videos and pull 20 minutes of the best clips and organize aspects of the videos based on videos when you're simply on the lift, videos that take place on specific ski runs, etc.
I know that I've cited using the power of IT/computers for use in ski videos on several occasions on this "README.md", but that is just a world/series of use cases where I have personal examples of the need for AI/machine learning/scripts/etc for resolving tedious tasks.

Separately, I would love to explore data analytics' use in understanding human behavior based on exogenous variables, e.g. the effect of sunny weather on a Saturday in increasing foot traffic to a mall vs. a river promenade.
I look forward to learning and creating projects with the rest of you.
